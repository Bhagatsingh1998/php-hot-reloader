# Change the getConfig() method name
# Add WATCHING on getConfig(), and IGNORING
# Create a Ignore method to add folders of files to ignore (absolute paths, if folder, merge scandir);
# Create a Include method to add folders of files to be watched beside the current ones or mode
# Do a nice output to currentConfig
# A way to see the a log of file changes
# Review the "local changes in js triggers a page reload". Turns it optional?
